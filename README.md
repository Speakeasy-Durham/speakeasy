# Speakeasy
### A social media platform for sharing and discovering user-created audio.

Social media network for audio. Users can make recordings of up to 30 second snippets as a creative outlet or way to connect with people and friends across distances. Meant to bring the hobby of mailing audio tapes across the country or saving special voicemails. 

Built on React Native using the Expo library, audio clips are uploaded to AWS s3, with Google Firebase used as the backend database. The code is hosted in a private repository on Github to keep AWS keys secure.
